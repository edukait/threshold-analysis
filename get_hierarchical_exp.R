  ## This method produces only one number for a collection of data/network (it is a global metric).  However, this method is based on averaging over the nodal (locally calculated) branching ratios, or scale factors, beta and gamma.  The idea is that we are sorting the beta and gamma distributions based on branch size (radii for beta and lengths for gamma), then binning (either linear or logarithmic) to then average across the size classes.  This approach could in principle be applied to the conservation exponent as well, but implementation has not yet occured.  In order to generate error bars, the method of boot-strapping is employed.  It is from the boot-strapping distribution that we also extract the mean value for the hierarchically averaged result. By setting plot = TRUE (the default), plots of the boot strapped distribution statistic are generated for use in checking robustness of approach in terms of distiribution normality and continuity.  To remove such plots, set plot = FALSE.  Also, the option to toggle the number of bootstrap simulations is available through runs.  The default is 1000, which is OK for basic testing.  For presenting results internally use 5000, for sharing results use 10000, for publishing use 100000.
